# Honors-Intro-Java-Projects

This a repo of my projects from CS1A at Foothill College. Assignments 1 and 2 were basic input/output demos that aren't included
because of their simplicity.

Assignment 3: A nutritional recipe calculator that takes your ingredients for a given recipe and spits out macronutrient info.

Assignment 4: A basic console interface for a program that counts the number of yogurt purchases you've made and offers you coupons

Assignment 5: A set of string manipulation methods, involving string reversal, character retrieval, and character masking

Assignment 6: A class called TripleString that is three strings, plus some helper methods

Assignment 7: A basic console interface for a simulated gambling machine that utilizes the class TripleString

Assignment 8: A calculator that determines the dating compatibility for two potential matches based on input values

Assignment 9: Practicing basic array sort methods

Assignment 10: More array manipulation methods, including sort and add/delete methods on an array of strings

All files include a sample output at the very end, so you'll have to take that out before they compile.
